    /Execution
        - ExecutionEngine.cs
        - ExecutionContext.cs
        - Scheduler.cs
        - ExecutionPipeline.cs
    /Nodes
        /BuiltIn
            - IfNode.cs

        - NodeRegistry.cs
        - NodeFactory.cs
    /Serialization
        - GraphSerializer.cs
        - GraphDeserializer.cs
        - VersioningSupport.cs
    /Integration
        - NodifyIntegrationAdapter.cs
        - WorkflowNodeViewModel.cs
    /Extensions
        - CustomNodeBase.cs
        - ExtensionHooks.cs
    /Utilities
        - LoggingHelper.cs

Test Project: Nodify.Workflow.Tests
Mirror the production folder names to keep the structure consistent:

/Nodify.Workflow.Tests
    /Core
        - GraphTests.cs
        - NodeInterfaceTests.cs
    /Execution
        - ExecutionEngineTests.cs
        - SchedulerTests.cs
        - ExecutionContextTests.cs
    /Nodes
        - IfNodeTests.cs
        - SetVariableNodeTests.cs
        - InputJsonNodeTests.cs
        - OutputNodeTests.cs
    /Registry
        - NodeRegistryTests.cs
        - NodeFactoryTests.cs
    /Serialization
        - GraphSerializationTests.cs
        - DeserializationTests.cs
    /Integration
        - IntegrationAdapterTests.cs
    /Extensions
        - CustomNodeTests.cs
    /Utilities
        - LoggingHelperTests.cs
2. Key Considerations

Consistency: Using the same folder names in both the main and test projects allows developers to quickly locate and relate tests to the corresponding production code.
Maintainability: This structure makes it easier to refactor or extend modules since both implementation and tests are grouped together by concern.
TDD Friendly: With tests organized in a parallel structure, you can follow the TDD cycle (Red/Green/Refactor) more seamlessly. Start by writing tests in the matching folder, then implement the minimal code in the corresponding production folder to pass those tests.
Developer Productivity: Consistent folder naming across projects minimizes cognitive load and speeds up onboarding for new team members.
