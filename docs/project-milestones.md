## Dependencies & Critical Path

1. Core Graph Model must be completed before Execution Engine
2. Node Registry depends on Graph Model
3. Integration Adapter depends on both Core Framework and Nodify understanding
4. Visual Execution features depend on both Execution Engine and Integration Adapter
5. Custom Node Framework depends on Node Registry and Serialization
6. Sample Applications depend on all core features and Nodify integration

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Nodify API changes | Medium | Create an abstraction layer to isolate Nodify-specific code |
| Performance issues with large workflows | High | Early profiling and optimization, incremental graph loading |
| Thread synchronization errors | High | Comprehensive thread safety testing, clear threading model documentation |
| UI/Backend state synchronization | Medium | Robust event system, snapshot-based comparison for verification |
| Custom node security concerns | Medium | Sandboxing for custom node execution, permission system |

## Success Criteria

1. Workflow library can execute all sample workflows correctly
2. Nodify integration provides seamless visual experience
3. Custom nodes can be created with minimal boilerplate
4. Serialization/deserialization preserves all workflow information
5. Performance meets targets for workflows with 100+ nodes
6. Documentation covers all major use cases and APIs
7. Unit test coverage exceeds 80%
