## Graph Model Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Node System
- **Node (`INode`, `Node`)**
  - Basic building block of the workflow
  - Contains input and output connectors
  - Maintains position information (X, Y) for UI representation
  - Ensures proper cleanup of connections when removed

#### 2. Connection System
- **Connector (`IConnector`, `Connector`)**
  - Represents connection points on nodes
  - Types: Input and Output (defined by `ConnectorDirection`)
  - Maintains a collection of active connections
  - Validates connection compatibility based on data types
  - Enforces connection constraints (e.g., single input)

- **Connection (`IConnection`, `Connection`)**
  - Links output connector to input connector
  - Maintains bidirectional relationships
  - Validates connection validity

### Design Decisions

#### 1. Bidirectional Relationship Pattern
The graph model maintains bidirectional relationships between components:

```plaintext
Node ←→ Connector ←→ Connection
```

**Why this approach?**
- **Performance**: O(1) access to related components
- **Consistency**: Easier to maintain graph integrity
- **Traversal**: Efficient navigation in any direction
- **Validation**: Quick access for constraint checking

**Trade-offs considered:**
- Memory usage vs. lookup performance
- Complexity of maintaining bidirectional relationships
- Alternative approaches (global registry, unidirectional relationships)

#### 2. Connection Collection in Connectors

Each connector maintains its own collection of connections, even though connections reference their endpoints. This design decision provides:

**Benefits:**
- O(1) access to all connections from a connector
- Simplified graph traversal
- Efficient validation of connection constraints
- Clean resource management

**Implementation considerations:**
```csharp
public class Connector : IConnector
{
    private readonly List<IConnection> _connections;
    
    public IReadOnlyCollection<IConnection> Connections => _connections.AsReadOnly();
    
    public bool AddConnection(IConnection connection)
    {
        // Validate before adding
        if (!ValidateConnection(connection)) return false;
        
        _connections.Add(connection);
        return true;
    }
}
```

#### 3. Graph Traversal Implementation

The `GraphTraversal` service implements various traversal algorithms:

**Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- Used for: Deep exploration, cycle detection
- Implementation: Recursive with visited set
- Time complexity: O(V + E)

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- Used for: Level-wise traversal, shortest paths
- Implementation: Queue-based with visited set
- Time complexity: O(V + E)

**Topological Sort**
- Used for: Execution order determination
- Implementation: DFS with reverse post-order
- Time complexity: O(V + E)

### Resource Management

#### 1. Connection Cleanup
- Connections are removed when:
  - A node is deleted
  - A connector is removed
  - The connection itself is explicitly removed
- Cleanup ensures both endpoints are properly updated

#### 2. Circular Reference Detection
- Implemented in the `Graph` class using depth-first search.
- Prevents creation of connections that would form a cycle (`Graph.TryAddConnection`).
- Supports full graph cycle detection for validation (`Graph.TryValidate`).

### Thread Safety Considerations

The current implementation is not thread-safe by default. When using in a multi-threaded environment:

- Use synchronization when modifying the graph
- Consider implementing a read-write lock pattern
- Be aware of potential race conditions in traversal

### Validation System

#### 1. Connection Validation
- Type compatibility checking
- Cardinality rules (e.g., single input)
- Custom validation rules support

#### 2. Node Validation
- Connector relationship validation
- Custom node-specific validation
- Graph-wide constraint checking

### Extension Points

#### 1. Custom Node Types
- Inherit from `Node` or implement `INode`
- Override validation as needed
- Add custom behavior

#### 2. Custom Validation Rules
- Implement custom validation logic
- Add type-specific constraints
- Extend existing validation system

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Time Complexity
- Node operations: O(1)
- Connection operations: O(1)
- Graph traversal: O(V + E)
- Path finding: O(V + E)
- Validation: O(1) to O(V + E)

### 2. Memory Usage
- Node: O(1) + O(C) where C = number of connectors
- Connector: O(1) + O(N) where N = number of connections
- Graph: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges

### 3. Optimization Opportunities
- Connection collection implementation
- Traversal algorithm improvements
- Validation caching
- Lazy loading of components

## Known Limitations

1. No built-in thread safety
2. Memory overhead from bidirectional relationships
3. Limited support for dynamic type validation

## Future Considerations

1. Thread safety implementation
2. Performance optimizations
3. Additional traversal algorithms
4. Enhanced validation system
5. Serialization improvements
