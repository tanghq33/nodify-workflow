## TDD Guidelines for Implementation

For each feature throughout the milestones:

1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests that define expected behavior
   - Define interfaces and contracts first
   - Include edge cases and error conditions
   - Create both unit and integration tests

2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Focus on making tests pass, not perfect implementation
   - Commit after each passing test
   - Verify all previously passing tests still pass

3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code while maintaining test compliance
   - Eliminate code duplication
   - Improve naming and organization
   - Optimize performance where appropriate
   - Ensure tests still pass after each refactoring step

4. **Documentation**: Document as part of the development cycle
   - Add XML documentation to public APIs
   - Update usage examples
   - Document design decisions and rationales

## Daily TDD Workflow

Each day should follow this pattern:

1. Morning: Review and update tests for the day's tasks
2. Mid-day: Implement features to pass the tests
3. Afternoon: Refactor and document
4. End of day: Commit code, review coverage reports, plan next day's tests

## Test Coverage Requirements

- Core Framework: 90%+ coverage
- Nodify Integration: 85%+ coverage
- Extension Framework: 85%+ coverage
