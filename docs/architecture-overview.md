# Backend-Focused Workflow Library Architecture

This document describes a high-level architecture design for a backend-focused workflow library. The library is designed to handle workflow execution and to integrate seamlessly with the Nodify node editor. It uses terminology consistent with Nodify, ensuring smooth interoperability between the backend execution and the visual graph construction.

---

## 1. Overall Architecture

The architecture is organized into several components:

- **Graph Model**: Represents the entire workflow as a graph, comprising nodes, connector, and connections.
- **Execution Engine**: Handles the runtime execution of the graph.
- **Node Abstraction & Registry**: Defines node behavior using familiar Nodify concepts, and supports both built-in and custom nodes.
- **Serialization/Deserialization Module**: Provides APIs for converting the graph to and from formats like JSON, allowing users to persist and load workflow definitions with their own storage solutions.
- **Integration Adapter**: Bridges the backend with UI editors such as Nodify, ensuring that the graph data and node configurations are interoperable.

## 2. Core Components

### a. Graph Model

- **Node**:
  - The basic building block, representing an individual operation.
  - Contains **Connector** for inputs and outputs (replacing traditional port terminology).
  - Holds **Execution Logic** that defines the operation performed by the node.
  - Stores **Metadata** such as node ID, configuration, and runtime state.

- **Connection**:
  - Represents the connection between nodes.
  - Connects an output connector from one node to an input connector on another.
  - Maintains connection details necessary for data flow during execution.

- **Graph**:
  - A container that holds the nodes and connections.
  - Defines the overall structure of the workflow and is the basis for execution.

### b. Execution Engine

- **Scheduler/Executor**:
  - Traverses the graph based on node dependencies and the flow of connections (data connections).
  - Determines the correct execution order for nodes.

- **Context Manager**:
  - Maintains the state during workflow execution.
  - Manages variable storage, conditional evaluations, and execution logs.

- **Execution Pipeline**:
  - Supports different execution models, such as sequential, parallel, and conditional branching.
  - For instance, an "If" node directs execution down different paths based on the evaluated condition.

### c. Node Abstraction & Registry

- **Node Interface / Abstract Base Class**:
  - Establishes a contract for node behavior with methods including:
    - `Execute(context)`: Runs the node’s logic.
    - `Validate()`: Checks node configuration before execution.
    - `Initialize()`: Prepares the node for execution.
  
- **Node Registry**:
  - Maps node types (e.g., "If", "Set Variable", "Input JSON", "Output") and supports dynamic instantiation during graph deserialization.
  
- **Custom Node Support**:
  - Users can extend the base node interface to create custom nodes.
  - Custom nodes are seamlessly integrated into the workflow via the registry.

### d. Serialization/Deserialization Module

- **API Design**:
  - Offers methods to serialize the graph (nodes, connector, and connections) into standard formats (JSON, XML, etc.).
  - Allows deserialization back into an in-memory graph representation.
  
- **Extensibility**:
  - Provides hooks for custom serialization strategies.
  - Leaves the choice of external storage or service integration to the user.

### e. Integration Adapter

- **UI-Agnostic API**:
  - Keeps execution logic separate from UI concerns, ensuring that the backend remains independent of any particular node editor.
  - Enables UI tools like Nodify to consume serialized graphs or bind to live execution data.
  
- **Configuration Adapter**:
  - Translates UI configurations (as defined in Nodify) into backend graph structures.
  - Supports a bidirectional conversion so that changes in the visual editor can be reflected in the workflow execution model and vice versa.

## 3. Example Workflow Nodes

The library should include a set of fundamental nodes, aligning with Nodify's approach and similar to nodes available in systems like n8n:

- **If Node**:
  - Evaluates a condition and directs the workflow along one of two links.
  
- **Set Variable Node**:
  - Introduces or updates data within the workflow context.
  
- **Input JSON Node**:
  - Enables the injection of JSON content into the workflow.
  
- **Output Node**:
  - Captures and finalizes the result of the workflow execution.

Each of these nodes follows the node interface, ensuring that they are consistent with Nodify’s terminology and can be extended or replaced as needed.

## 4. Extensibility and Customization

- **Custom Nodes**:
  - Developers can create their own nodes by subclassing the provided node interface.
  - Custom nodes are registered in the Node Registry for seamless integration.

- **Dynamic Workflow Construction**:
  - Workflows can be dynamically built, modified, and persisted externally.
  - The design supports live updates from UI tools like Nodify.

- **Execution Context Hooks**:
  - Offers extension points such as pre- and post-execution hooks.
  - Allows integration of additional logic like logging, error handling, and other cross-cutting concerns.

---

## 5. Deployment Considerations

- **Decoupling**:
  - The backend workflow library is independent of UI-specific libraries, ensuring clean separation.
  
- **Thread Safety**:
  - Implements proper synchronization or asynchronous execution patterns for multi-threaded environments.
  
- **Testing & Debugging**:
  - Includes robust logging and error handling to aid in debugging complex workflows.

## 6. Conclusion

This architecture offers a modular, extensible, and decoupled solution for a backend-focused workflow library that works seamlessly with the Nodify node editor. By leveraging Nodify's terminology—such as nodes, connectors, connections, and graphs—the design ensures smooth integration between the backend execution engine and the visual workflow editor. This provides a robust foundation for developing and executing dynamic workflows while remaining flexible and customizable.
